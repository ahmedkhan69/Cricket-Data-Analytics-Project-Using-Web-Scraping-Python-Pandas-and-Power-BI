# Project Overview

In this project, I have worked on analyzing data from the T20 World Cup 2022 to generate insights and create a data-driven analysis of the best 11 players.

# The project covers the following key steps:

1. Data Collection
I gathered data from the T20 World Cup 2022 using web scraping techniques with the Bright Data platform. The data was sourced from ESPNcricinfo, a well-known platform for cricket statistics.

2. Data Transformation and Cleaning
Once the data was collected, I performed necessary data transformations and cleaning using the powerful pandas library in Python. This step ensures that the data is in the right format for analysis and that there are no inconsistencies or missing values.

3. Insights Generation
After cleaning the data, I delved into generating insights about the best 11 players from the T20 World Cup 2022. This involved conducting statistical analysis and decision-making to identify the players with the best performances.

4. Dashboard Creation
To present the findings, I created interactive dashboards using Power BI. These visualizations provide an easy way to understand and share the analysis results, helping to make the decision-making process clearer.

# Project Benefits

- Resume Enhancement: This project is an excellent addition to a data science resume. It showcases skills in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization – all essential skills for any data scientist.

- Guided Project: Although the project is structured to help beginners and advanced users, I have included all materials, code, and instructions so others can replicate the project easily.
