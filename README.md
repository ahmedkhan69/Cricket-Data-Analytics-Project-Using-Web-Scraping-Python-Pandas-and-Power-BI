# Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to analyze and generate insights from the T20 World Cup 2022. By applying a combination of web scraping, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, the project aims to identify the best 11 players from the tournament, providing data-driven insights for team selection. The project combines both technical and analytical skills using Python (with pandas for data cleaning and transformation) and Power BI for visualizing the insights.

# The project covers the following key steps:

1. Data Collection
I gathered data from the T20 World Cup 2022 using web scraping techniques with the Bright Data platform. The data was sourced from ESPNcricinfo, a well-known platform for cricket statistics.

2. Data Transformation and Cleaning
Once the data was collected, I performed necessary data transformations and cleaning using the powerful pandas library in Python. This step ensures that the data is in the right format for analysis and that there are no inconsistencies or missing values.

3. Insights Generation
After cleaning the data, I delved into generating insights about the best 11 players from the T20 World Cup 2022. This involved conducting statistical analysis and decision-making to identify the players with the best performances.

4. Dashboard Creation
To present the findings, I created interactive dashboards using Power BI. These visualizations provide an easy way to understand and share the analysis results, helping to make the decision-making process clearer.
